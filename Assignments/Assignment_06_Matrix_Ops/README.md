# Assignment #6: Matrix Operations and Construction

## Description
This assignment demonstrates fundamental matrix operations in R, including addition, subtraction, and construction of diagonal and custom block-structured matrices. The tasks focus on:  

- Performing basic matrix arithmetic (addition and subtraction)  
- Creating diagonal matrices using `diag()`  
- Constructing a custom 5Ã—5 block-structured matrix programmatically  
- Documenting code and results clearly for reproducibility  

## How to Run
1. Open the script file `Assignment_06.R` in RStudio.  
2. Run all lines of code or use `source("Assignment_06.R")`.  
3. The console will display the results of matrix operations and the constructed matrices.  

## Packages
- None required; all operations use base R functions.  

## Data
- No external datasets are required; matrices are defined directly in the script.
