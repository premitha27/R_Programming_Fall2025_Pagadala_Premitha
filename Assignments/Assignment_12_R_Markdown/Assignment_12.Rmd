## R Markdown

# Introduction

R Markdown is a powerful tool for combining narrative text, code, and output in a single document. It allows analysts and researchers to create **reproducible reports**, where the analysis can be rerun with fresh data and results automatically updated.
In bioinformatics, this is especially useful for analyzing **gene expression data**, as we can document our workflow and update results automatically.
For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

# Narrative Section

RNA-Seq experiments generate massive amounts of data representing **gene expression levels** across samples.  
Bioinformaticians often need to summarize, visualize, and statistically test this data to find **differentially expressed genes**.  

# LaTeX Math Examples

Bioinformatics often uses **mathematical models** to describe biological processes. For example, a common equation in genetics is **Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium**:
Inline: $p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1$

Displayed:

$$
p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1
$$

Where:

- $p$ = frequency of allele A  
- $q$ = frequency of allele a  

# Load Libraries and Data
# Install Bioconductor if needed
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
  install.packages("BiocManager")

# Load necessary libraries
BiocManager::install("airway", update = FALSE, ask = FALSE)
library(airway)
library(DESeq2)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)

# Load the airway dataset
data("airway")
airway

# Explore the Dataset
# Convert to a DESeq2 object
dds <- DESeqDataSet(airway, design = ~ cell + dex)
# Check counts for the first 6 genes
head(counts(dds))

# Simple Analysis: Normalization
# Normalize counts using DESeq2's variance stabilizing transformation (VST)
vsd <- vst(dds, blind = FALSE)

# Summary statistics for a few genes
assay(vsd)[1:6,]

# Visualization: PCA Plot
# Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to visualize samples
pca <- prcomp(t(assay(vsd)))
pca_data <- as.data.frame(pca$x)
pca_data$Sample <- colnames(vsd)
pca_data$Treatment <- colData(vsd)$dex
ggplot(pca_data, aes(PC1, PC2, color = Treatment, label = Sample)) +
geom_point(size = 4) +
geom_text(vjust = -0.5) +
theme_minimal() +
labs(title = "PCA of RNA-Seq Samples")

# Reflection
Using R Markdown with bioinformatics datasets like RNA-Seq offers clear advantages:

- Reproducibility: All analysis steps are documented in one file.
- Integration of text, math, and code: Results are automatically linked with interpretations.
- Visualization: PCA plots and other figures are embedded directly.
- Workflow tracking: Easy to revisit and update analyses.

Compared to static reports, this approach reduces errors, improves clarity, and facilitates collaboration.

# Conclusion
This primer demonstrated:
- Loading a real RNA-Seq dataset from Bioconductor.
- Performing basic normalization and exploratory analysis.
- Visualizing gene expression patterns using PCA.
- Documenting a complete bioinformatics workflow in R Markdown.
