## Assignment 2 â€“ Importing Data and Function Evaluation in R  

**Blog Link:** [Assignment 2 Blog Post](https://premithapagadala.blogspot.com/2025/09/assignment-2-importing-data-and.html)  

### Description
This assignment demonstrates importing data into RStudio, testing a custom function, and debugging it. The main task was to define a vector of numeric values, evaluate the given `myMean` function, identify why it fails, and create a corrected version that successfully calculates the mean. The script also verifies the output of the corrected function.  

### How to Run
1. Open the project file `Assignment_02.R` in RStudio.  
2. Run all lines of code or use `source("Assignment_02.R")`.  
3. The console will display the result of the original function test, the error message, and the correct mean value using the fixed function.  

### Data
- **Source:** Provided vector within the assignment.  
- **Location:** Defined in the script as `assignment2 <- c(16, 18, 14, 22, 27, 17, 19, 17, 17, 22, 20, 22)`.  

### Notes
- Original function failed due to mismatched variable names (`assignment` vs. `assignment2` and `someData`).  
- Corrected function uses consistent variable naming.  
- No external files or datasets are required.
