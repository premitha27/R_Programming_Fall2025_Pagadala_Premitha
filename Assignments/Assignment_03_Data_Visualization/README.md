## Assignment 3 â€“ Analyzing 2016 Poll Data in R  

**Blog Link:** [Assignment 3 Blog Post](https://premithapagadala.blogspot.com/2025/09/assignment-3.html)  

### Description
This assignment involves creating and inspecting a data frame of fictional 2016 poll data, computing summary statistics, and visualizing results using `ggplot2`. It also introduces data manipulation (calculating differences between polls) and reflection on data quality.  

### How to Run
1. Open the project file `Assignment_03.R` in RStudio.  
2. Run all lines of code or use `source("Assignment_03.R")`.  
3. The script produces summary statistics in the console and generates bar charts of poll data using `ggplot2`. Plots can be saved as PNGs if needed.  

### Packages
- `ggplot2` for plotting.  
- `dplyr` (optional) for data manipulation.  

### Data
- **Source:** Fictional poll data provided in the assignment.  
- **Location:** Defined within the script as vectors: `Name`, `ABC_poll`, and `CBS_poll`.  

### Notes
- Made-up data may not reflect real-world polling; conclusions are illustrative.  
- Includes a column calculating the difference between CBS and ABC polls.  
- The script is fully reproducible and does not require external files.
